# GM-APClientPP GML

This is work in progress.

This contains GML (script) code to put into the game.
Note that you have to run the code in `_init.gml` on startup, or at latest before you first use apclient.

`events/` contains sample GML code to run when receiving events. You need to implement all of them as described in the
[main README file](../README.md).
